# ProcessingSharp

A C# library that aims to bring similar functionality to the Java library 'Processing', to C# using OpenTK.

## How to:

- Clone the Repo
- Type your code within Program.cs in the P5CS project
- Global settings can be found in the Globals.cs in the ProcessingSharp project

Not all features are yet to be added as this is a work in progress

## Coming Soonâ„¢

- Perlin noise
- Lines and points
- Better code lol
- 3D? Maybe.

## Already Added:

- Circles, Ellipses, Rectangles, Squares
- Shape specific fill color, stroke color, stroke weight
- Transformations and rotations
- Static functions from Processing such as map, dist, etc.

# Why use this over Processing?

Dont... Well not yet anyway. That is unless you prefer C# over Java as I do. I'm developing this in the hope that this library becomes as functional as Processing.

This library is decently efficient so far, hopefully that will remain true in the future.
